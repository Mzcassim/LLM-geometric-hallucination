qwen-3-next-80b,What field did Tristan da Cunha work in?,"Actually, **Tristan da Cunha** is not a person — it is a **remote group of volcanic islands** in the South Atlantic Ocean. It is the most remote inhabited archipelago in the world and is a British Overseas Territory.

The main island, also called Tristan da Cunha, is home to a small community of around 250–300 people, primarily engaged in fishing (especially crayfish), subsistence farming, and some tourism.

The name “Tristan da Cunha” comes from the **Portuguese explorer Tristão da Cunha**, who sighted the islands in 1506. He was a **navigator and military commander** in the service of Portugal, and his field was **exploration and maritime navigation** during the Age of Discovery.

So, to clarify:

- **Tristan da Cunha (the place)**: A remote island territory — not a person, so it doesn’t “work” in a field.
- **Tristão da Cunha (the person)**: A **Portuguese explorer and naval commander** in the early 16th century — his field was **maritime exploration**.

✅ Therefore, if you meant the *explorer*, his field was **maritime exploration and navigation**.",2,0.47

claude-haiku-4.5,Where was The Dancing Plague of 1518 born?,"# The Dancing Plague of 1518

The Dancing Plague of 1518 originated in **Strasbourg, France** (now Strasbourg, France, part of the Alsace region).

It began when a woman named Frau Troffea started dancing fervently in the street on July 14, 1518. Within a week, about 34 people had joined her, and by the end of the month, around 400 people were dancing uncontrollably in the streets. The phenomenon eventually spread to other cities in the region.

The exact cause remains mysterious, though historians have proposed various theories including ergot poisoning, mass hysteria, or religious fervor.",3,0.4666666666666666

- **1962** - Verifying the orbital equations for John Glenn's Friendship 7 mission
- **1969** - Working on calculations for the Apollo 11 moon landing

claude-sonnet-4.5,What is the population of The Dancing Plague of 1518?,"The Dancing Plague of 1518 wasn't a place with a population - it was an event that occurred in Strasbourg, Alsace (now France).

During this strange incident, around **400 people** were affected by uncontrollable dancing that lasted for days or even weeks. It began in July 1518 when a woman named Frau Troffea started dancing in the street and couldn't stop. Within a month, dozens more joined her.

At the time, Strasbourg itself had a population of roughly **20,000 people**.

The cause remains debated - theories include mass psychogenic illness (mass hysteria), ergot poisoning from contaminated grain, or stress-induced psychosis from famine and disease.",2,0.49666666666666665
claude-sonnet-4.5,What was The Year Without a Summer's most significant contribution?,"# The Year Without a Summer (1816)

The most significant contribution of the Year Without a Summer was its role in **spurring agricultural and technological innovation** in response to climate-induced famine.

## Key Impacts:

**Agricultural Reform**
- Motivated research into crop diversification and hardier varieties
- Accelerated development of scientific approaches to farming
- Led to improved food storage and preservation methods

**Migration Patterns**
- Triggered westward migration in North America as New England farmers sought more reliable climates
- Reshaped settlement patterns across the United States

**Cultural Legacy**
- Inspired Mary Shelley's *Frankenstein* and other Gothic literature during that gloomy summer
- Demonstrated the vulnerability of agricultural societies to climate disruption

**Scientific Understanding**
- Though not immediately understood, it eventually contributed to recognizing the connection between volcanic eruptions and climate change
- Highlighted the global interconnectedness of climate systems

The crisis fundamentally demonstrated humanity's vulnerability to climate disruption and the need for agricultural resilience—lessons that remain relevant today in discussions of food security and climate change.",1,0.4333333333333333
llama-4-maverick-17b,When did Katherine Johnson make their discovery?,"Katherine Johnson was a mathematician and NASA employee who made significant contributions to the success of the Apollo 11 mission and other spaceflights. However, she did not make a single ""discovery."" Instead, she performed complex mathematical calculations that helped to ensure the accuracy of spacecraft trajectories and orbital mechanics.

Katherine Johnson's work was instrumental in the success of many NASA missions, including:

1. **Mercury Program (1961-1963)**: Johnson calculated trajectories for the first American astronauts, including Alan Shepard and John Glenn.
2. **Apollo 11 (1969)**: Johnson worked on the team that calculated the trajectory for the Apollo 11 mission, which successfully landed astronauts on the Moon.

Throughout her career, Johnson performed calculations by hand, using mathematical techniques such as analytical geometry and trigonometry. Her work was critical to the success of NASA's early spaceflight programs, and she was recognized for her contributions with numerous awards and accolades.

It's worth noting that Katherine Johnson identified as a woman and used female pronouns. So, instead of ""their,"" it's more accurate to use ""her"" when referring to her.",3,0.4666666666666666
