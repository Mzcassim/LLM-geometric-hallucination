gpt-5.1,What did Dr. Robert Mackenzie discover?,"There have been several scientists and physicians named Robert (or Rob) Mackenzie, so the answer depends on which one you mean. A few notable possibilities:

1. **Dr. Robert T. MacKenzie (or McKenzie) – pulmonary medicine**  
   - Known for work on **pulmonary function testing** and **respiratory physiology**, especially in relation to exercise and lung disease.  
   - Contributed to understanding how lung mechanics and gas exchange change with disease and physical activity, but is not typically credited with a single, named “discovery.”

2. **Dr. Robert A. McKenzie – geology/geophysics**  
   - Sometimes confused with Dan McKenzie (a major figure in plate tectonics).  
   - If you’re thinking of plate tectonics or the theory of rigid-plate motion, that key work is associated with **Dan McKenzie**, not Robert.

3. **Other physicians named Robert Mackenzie**  
   - There are clinicians in oncology, surgery, and pediatrics with this name who have contributed to their fields through research and practice, but not with a famous, singular discovery widely cited in textbooks.

To give you an accurate answer, I need a bit more detail about him—do you know:
- His field (medicine, geology, psychology, etc.)?
- Rough time period (19th century, mid‑1900s, recent)?
- Any context (e.g., “a doctor who worked on X disease” or “a Canadian physician,” etc.)?

With that, I can narrow down the specific Dr. Robert Mackenzie and what he’s known for.",2,0.2911111111111111
