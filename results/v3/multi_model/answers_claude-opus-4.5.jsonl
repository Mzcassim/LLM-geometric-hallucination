Sustainability of what, and for whom?\n- The answer likely depends heavily on context: timeframe, what's being sustained, what's being innovated, and who bears the costs.\n\n**Where the tension is real:**\n\nSometimes they do conflict. Moving fast and breaking things can create waste, externalities, or path dependencies. Prioritizing stability can mean missing opportunities or locking in inadequate systems.\n\n**My honest take:**\n\nI don't think either deserves blanket priority. I'd suggest the better question is: *What are we trying to achieve, and what combination of innovation and sustainability serves that?* \n\nSome situations call for precaution; others call for bold experimentation.
