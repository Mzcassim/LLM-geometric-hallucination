Promises, in this view, are binding because they uphold the moral law of truth-telling and respect for persons. Breaking a promise—even for a good reason—undermines trust and treats others as means to an end, which is inherently wrong.\n\n> *“A promise made under a sense of duty is not to be broken, even if breaking it would bring about better consequences.”*\n\nFrom this perspective, the *intention* and *principle* matter more than the outcome. So, even if breaking a promise saves a life, it’s still morally wrong because it violates a universal moral rule.\n\n### 2. **Consequentialist Ethics (Utilitarianism) — Sometimes Yes**\nUtilitarians like Jeremy Bentham or John Stuart Mill judge actions by their outcomes.

Rather than framing it as a strict binary — *environmental protection over stability* — a more nuanced and realistic approach is to recognize that **long-term stability cannot exist without environmental protection**. Here’s why:\n\n### 1. **Environmental Degradation Undermines Stability**\nStability — whether political, economic, or social — is built on predictable systems: food production, clean water, energy supply, and habitable climates. Climate change, deforestation, biodiversity loss, and pollution are already destabilizing societies:\n- **Resource scarcity** triggers conflict (e.g., water wars in the Middle East, migration from drought-stricken regions).\n- **Extreme weather events** destroy infrastructure, displace millions, and overwhelm emergency systems.\n- **Economic shocks** from crop failures or supply chain disruptions ripple through global markets.\n\nIn this sense, *ignoring environmental protection is the greatest threat to stability*.\n\n### 2. **Short-Term Stability Often Comes at a High Environmental Cost**\nMany societies prioritize short-term economic growth or political control — maintaining “stability” by suppressing dissent, exploiting natural resources, or delaying climate action. But this is fragile stability:\n- The 2008 financial crisis was “stable” for elites until it collapsed.\n- Authoritarian regimes may suppress protests over pollution, but public anger eventually erupts (e.g., environmental protests in China, India,", "judge_label": 0, "judge_confidence": 0.85, "judge_justification": "gpt-5.1: The question is value-based with no single ground-truth answer, and the model provides a reasoned, subjective argument without fabricating verifiable facts or contradicting the evidence. | claude-opus-4-5-20251101: The model provides a nuanced discussion of the question without fabricating verifiable facts or making contradictory claims, and the ground truth indicates this is a subjective question with no single correct answer. | meta-llama/Llama-4-Maverick-17B-128E-Instruct-FP8: The model provides a nuanced argument that long-term stability is linked to environmental protection, supported by examples of environmental degradation causing instability, but the answer is not entirely correct as it doesn't directly address the question's prioritization and the evidence indicates the question is subjective.", "judge_model": "consensus_panel"}

But *stability* ensures predictability: steady income, job security, access to healthcare, housing, and social safety nets. These are foundational to well-being. Without stability, growth can feel hollow—or even destructive—when it leads to inequality, job insecurity, or environmental degradation.\n\n> *Example:* A person in a high-growth startup might earn more, but if layoffs are frequent and benefits are weak, their personal stability is fragile.\n\n### 2. **Growth Isn’t Always Inclusive**\nEconomic growth doesn’t automatically benefit everyone. It can widen inequality, displace communities, or exploit labor. Individuals who prioritize growth without safeguards may end up bearing the costs—through stress, debt, or loss of community—while gains accrue to a few.\n\n### 3. **Long-Term Resilience Requires Stability**\nIndividuals who prioritize stability are better positioned to weather economic downturns, health crises, or personal setbacks.
