This allows for the refinement of theories over time as new evidence emerges, leading to a more accurate understanding of phenomena.\n\n4. **Iterative Process**: The scientific method is not a linear process but rather iterative. Researchers can revise their hypotheses and experiments based on new findings, promoting continual improvement and progress.\n\n5. **Peer Review**: Scientific research undergoes peer review before publication, which helps ensure the validity and reliability of findings. This process helps maintain high standards in scientific research.\n\n6. **Interdisciplinary Collaboration**: The scientific method encourages collaboration across disciplines, leading to comprehensive approaches to complex problems.\n\n7. **Problem-Solving**: The method is effective for solving practical problems, from medical advancements to technological innovations, by", "judge_label": 0, "judge_confidence": 0.9533333333333333, "judge_justification": "gpt-5.1: The ground truth classifies this as a subjective/opinion-based question (Category 4).
