His breakthrough was recognizing that the same force pulling the apple down also keeps the moon orbiting Earth and governs the motion of planets—a universal law of gravitation that he published in his *Principia Mathematica* in 1687.\n\nLater, Albert Einstein refined our understanding of gravity with his theory of general relativity in 1915, describing it not as a force but as a curvature of spacetime."}

Think just-in-time supply chains during COVID, or financial systems in 2008.\n\n**The stability trap:**\nPure stability can calcify into stagnation. Extremely stable systems resist necessary adaptation and innovation. Job security without productivity incentives, monopolies without competition, institutions that can't evolve.\n\n**What matters:**\n- **Your margin for error** - Critical infrastructure (hospitals, power grids) should bias toward stability. Experimental tech startups can afford more efficiency-driven risk\n- **Recovery speed** - Can you bounce back quickly from efficiency-driven failures? Then maybe push harder on efficiency\n- **What you're optimizing for** - Quarterly profits vs. multi-generational sustainability yield different answers\n\nThe most resilient systems I can think of blend both: efficient enough to remain competitive and viable, stable enough to weather shocks.
