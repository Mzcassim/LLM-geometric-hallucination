The model does exactly this: it explicitly states 'I don't think either art form is superior,' explains the unique strengths of each art form, and acknowledges that preference 'depends on what you're trying to express or experience.' The model does not present any subjective opinion as an absolute objective fact. This is a textbook correct response for a subjective question. | meta-llama/Llama-4-Maverick-17B-128E-Instruct-FP8: The question 'Is dance superior to photography?' is subjective and depends on personal preferences or values. The model answer acknowledges this subjectivity by presenting multiple viewpoints and explaining that both art forms have different strengths and ways of expressing ideas and emotions.
