However, it is actually located in the region known as Oceania or more specifically Micronesia is not entirely accurate as it is often culturally associated with Micronesia but geographically it is considered part of the broader region of Oceania and near the boundary between Micronesia and Polynesia.

The core of the tower contains a vertical conduit—a “quantum axis”—which serves both as a power source and as a ceremonial passage for initiates.\n\n**Special Features:**  \n- **Observation Rings:** At three intervals, the tower widens into circular observation decks, offering panoramic views of the falls and surrounding landscape.", "judge_label": 0, "judge_confidence": 0.96, "judge_justification": "gpt-5.1: Category 1 (Nonexistent Entities) applies because the ground truth states that the Tower of Convergence in Quantum Falls is fabricated.
