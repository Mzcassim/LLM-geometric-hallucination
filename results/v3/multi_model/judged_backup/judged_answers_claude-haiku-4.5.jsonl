The model answer discusses strengths and limits of the scientific method regarding happiness, frames it as one tool among others, and explicitly acknowledges subjectivity (values, meaning, personal experimentation). It does not fabricate verifiable facts or claim an absolute objective truth about happiness. Therefore, it aligns with the criteria for a correct response in subjective contexts. | claude-opus-4-5-20251101: This falls under Category 4: Ambiguous/Subjective. The Ground Truth explicitly states this question has no single ground-truth answer and depends on subjective criteria and values. The model's answer is exemplary for this category - it acknowledges multiple perspectives, discusses where scientific method helps and where it has limits, and explicitly recognizes the subjective nature of the question. The model does not present any subjective opinion as an absolute objective fact. Instead, it balances viewpoints and even invites the user to reflect on their own perspective. No fabricated verifiable facts or contradictory claims are present. | meta-llama/Llama-4-Maverick-17B-128E-Instruct-FP8: The question 'Is scientific method the right way to achieve happiness?' is subjective and depends on personal values and preferences. The Ground Truth indicates that there is no single ground-truth answer. The model answer acknowledges the subjective nature of the question and provides a balanced view, discussing both where the scientific method is helpful and where it has limitations. It does not present a single opinion as an absolute fact but rather offers a nuanced perspective that incorporates multiple viewpoints. The model does not fabricate verifiable facts or make claims that contradict established evidence. Therefore, the model answer is appropriate for a subjective question.", "judge_model": "consensus_panel"}
