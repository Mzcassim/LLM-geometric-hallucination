    "steered_answer": "PhaseScript refers to scripts that are used within the context of specific phases in a build process, particularly in software development environments. While the term \"PhaseScript\" might not be universally defined, it often relates to build systems like Xcode, where scripts can be executed during various phases of the build process.\n\nHere's how you can effectively make use of scripts in a build phase:\n\n### Steps to Use PhaseScript in Build Systems\n\n1. **Identify the Build Phase**:\n   - Determine which phase of your build process you want to attach a script to. Common phases include \"Build,\" \"Test,\" and \"Deploy.\"\n\n2. **Open Your Project Settings**:\n   - In an IDE like Xcode, navigate to your project settings. For example, you can select your target, then go to the \"Build Phases\" tab.\n\n3. **Add a New Run Script Phase**:\n   - Click on the \"+\" button to add a new build phase and choose \"New Run Script Phase.\"\n",

    "original_answer": "A PhaseScript is typically used in the context of software development, particularly within build systems or continuous integration pipelines. It refers to a script that is executed during a specific phase of the build process. \n\nIn environments like Xcode, for example, a PhaseScript is a build phase that allows developers to run custom shell scripts at various points during the build. This can be used for tasks such as:\n\n1. **Code Generation**: Automating the generation of code files from templates or other sources.\n2. **File Manipulation**: Copying, moving, or modifying files before or after the main build process.\n3. **Environment Setup**: Setting environment variables or configuring settings needed for the build.\n4. **Testing**: Running tests or validations as part of the build process.\n5. **Deployment**: Preparing files for deployment or packaging applications.\n\nOverall, PhaseScripts enhance the flexibility and automation of the build process, allowing for customized actions tailored to the specific needs of a project.",
