Before the theorem was proved by Andrew Wiles in 1994, there were several partial results and special cases that had been established over the centuries. Here are some key points in the history of the theorem's exploration prior to its proof:

1. **Initial Cases**: Fermat himself proved the theorem for \(n = 3\) and \(n = 4\). The case for \(n = 3\) was shown by considering the equation modulo 3 and the case for \(n = 4\) was proven using the method of infinite descent.

2. **Larger Exponents**: Many mathematicians proved the theorem for specific larger values of \(n\). For instance, Euler proved it for \(n = 5\), and Dirichlet and Legendre extended this to various other specific odd primes.

3. **General Cases**: The theorem was proven for many classes of integers, including:
   - All \(n\) that are prime numbers.
   - Various composite numbers, often by reducing the problem to the cases of prime factors.

4. **Modular Forms and Elliptic Curves**: In the 1980s, a significant approach developed by Andrew Wiles involved the connection between Fermat's Last Theorem and the Taniyama-Shimura-Weil conjecture (now a theorem), which linked elliptic curves and modular forms. The proof of Fermat's Last Theorem was ultimately achieved by proving this conjecture for a specific class of elliptic curves.
