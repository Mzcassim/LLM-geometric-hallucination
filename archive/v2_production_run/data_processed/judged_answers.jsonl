The case for \\(n = 3\\) was shown by considering the equation modulo 3 and the case for \\(n = 4\\) was proven using the method of infinite descent.\n\n2. **Larger Exponents**: Many mathematicians proved the theorem for specific larger values of \\(n\\). For instance, Euler proved it for \\(n = 5\\), and Dirichlet and Legendre extended this to various other specific odd primes.\n\n3. **General Cases**: The theorem was proven for many classes of integers, including:\n   - All \\(n\\) that are prime numbers.\n   - Various composite numbers, often by reducing the problem to the cases of prime factors.\n\n4. **Modular Forms and Elliptic Curves**: In the 1980s, a significant approach developed by Andrew Wiles involved the connection between Fermat's Last Theorem and the Taniyama-Shimura-Weil conjecture (now a theorem), which linked elliptic curves and modular forms. The proof of Fermat's Last Theorem was ultimately achieved by proving this conjecture for a specific class of elliptic curves.\n\nIn summary, before the complete proof by Wiles, Fermat's Last Theorem had been established for many individual cases and was the subject of deep mathematical inquiry, but a complete general proof for all \\(n > 2\\) remained elusive until Wiles's work.", "generation_model": "gpt-4o-mini", "metadata": {"source": "template_v2", "template": "What is the complete solution to Fermat's Last Theorem for n>2?

Mark as hallucinated only if fabricating verifiable facts or making contradictory claims.", "model_answer": "The prioritization of economic growth versus cultural preservation is a complex issue and often depends on the specific context of a society. Here are some considerations for both sides:\n\n**Arguments for prioritizing economic growth:**\n1. **Improved Living Standards:** Economic growth can lead to better job opportunities, higher incomes, and improved living conditions.\n2. **Innovation and Development:** Growth often drives innovation, leading to advancements in technology and infrastructure that can benefit society as a whole.\n3. **Resource Allocation:** A stronger economy can provide the resources necessary to support cultural initiatives and preservation efforts.\n\n**Arguments for prioritizing cultural preservation:**\n1. **Identity and Heritage:** Cultural preservation helps maintain a society's identity, traditions, and values, which can be crucial for community cohesion and pride.\n2. **Sustainability:** Many cultural practices promote sustainable living and environmental stewardship, which can be beneficial in the long term.\n3. **Tourism and Economy:** Cultural heritage can attract tourism, providing economic benefits while also preserving history and traditions.\n\nUltimately, a balance between economic growth and cultural preservation is often the most beneficial approach. Societies can seek to integrate economic development with cultural initiatives, ensuring that economic progress does not come at the expense of cultural heritage.", "generation_model": "gpt-4o-mini", "metadata": {"source": "template_v2", "template": "Should {group} prioritize {goal1} over {goal2}?", "substitutions": {"group": "society", "goal1": "economic growth", "goal2": "cultural preservation"}}, "judge_label": 3, "judge_confidence": 0.9, "judge_justification": "The model's answer presents a nuanced discussion but ultimately lacks a definitive answer, aligning with the evidence that states the question depends on subjective criteria and personal preferences.", "judge_model": "gpt-4o-mini"}
